## About This application

In this beta version i used a temporary database of my own just to vizualise the output of my code, this is due to some problems which i encountered during the importation of the real database from the code challenge but i will take care of that part at the end.That is why you need to execute these two command lines below in order to create shops table and fill it with some data.

- php artisan migrate
- php artisan db:seed
